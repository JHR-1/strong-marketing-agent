# Strong Recruitment Group — Marketing Agent

A persistent Node.js marketing automation service for **Strong Recruitment Group**.
Once a month it plans the full content calendar for next month
(12 social posts + 2 blog posts), sends it to Telegram for review,
accepts user-uploaded images from ChatGPT 5.5, matches each image to a
post, and then schedules every post across all five connected channels
via the [Zernio](https://zernio.com) API.

```
GPT-4.1            →  monthly content calendar (12 social + 2 blog)
                      → topic / caption / hashtags / image idea
Telegram bot       →  shows you the calendar for review
You (ChatGPT 5.5)  →  create each image, send to the bot
Telegram bot       →  ask "which post number?", attach image
/schedule          →  Zernio schedules everything across
                      Facebook · Instagram · LinkedIn · Twitter/X · Google Business
```

The agent no longer generates images itself — Nick designs them in
ChatGPT 5.5 following the in-house style guide
(`assets/style-guide.md`) and uploads them via Telegram.

## What it does

1. **Calendar planning** — On `/generate` (or the monthly cron, default
   `0 9 20 * *` Europe/London) `GPT-4.1` plans:
   - **12 social posts** scheduled Mon / Wed / Fri at 09:00 UK across
     the next 4 weeks.
   - **2 blog posts** scheduled on dedicated Mon/Wed/Fri slots later in
     the month and published as social-media promo posts (blog image +
     promo caption + blog link).
   - Content mix rotates across all 7 sectors (M&E, Construction,
     Driving & Transport, Data Centres, Rail & Infrastructure, Fit-Out
     & Interiors, Residential) and the main UK / international
     awareness days.
2. **Review** — The Telegram bot sends the full calendar as a numbered
   list (1–14). Each entry shows the topic, scheduled date/time,
   caption, hashtags, and a suggested image description.
3. **Image collection** — You create each image in ChatGPT 5.5 and
   send them to the bot. For every photo the bot asks "which post
   number?" — reply with the number, or send the photo with the number
   already in the caption ("3").
4. **Scheduling** — `/schedule` pushes all 14 posts to Zernio for
   their planned date/time across **Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn,
   Twitter/X and Google Business**. Blog promo posts include the blog
   URL (set with `/seturl <post#> <url>`) appended to the caption.
5. **Persistence** — Calendars, posts, blogs and Zernio post IDs are
   stored in SQLite (`/app/data/agent.db`). User-uploaded images are
   stored on disk under `/app/data/images/` and served at
   `${PUBLIC_BASE_URL}/images/<file>` so Zernio can fetch them.

## Telegram commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/generate` | Plan next month's calendar (12 social posts + 2 blog posts) and send it for review |
| `/calendar` | Re-send the active calendar |
| `/status`   | Show which posts already have an image and which still need one |
| `/seturl <post#> <url>` | Set the blog URL for a blog promo post (replaces `<BLOG_URL>` in the caption) |
| `/schedule` | Once every post has an image, schedule all 14 posts on Zernio |
| `/reset`    | Wipe the active calendar and start over |
| `/cancel`   | Cancel a pending image assignment |
| `/help`     | Show the commands list |

When you send a photo without a caption number, the bot replies with a
numbered list of all 14 posts and asks which one the image is for.
You can also reply to the bot's "which post?" question with any
integer, or send the photo with the number already in the caption.

## Local development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JHR-1/strong-marketing-agent.git
cd strong-marketing-agent
cp .env.example .env        # fill in OPENAI_API_KEY, ZERNIO_*, TELEGRAM_*
npm install
npm run dev
```

The agent will:
- listen on `http://localhost:3000`
- start polling Telegram (if `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` is set)
- arm the monthly cron job

To trigger a calendar generation right now:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3000/generate-calendar"
```

(or send `/generate` to the Telegram bot)

---

## HTTP endpoints

If `TRIGGER_SECRET` is set, pass it as `?secret=...` or in the
`x-trigger-secret` header for the protected routes.

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `GET`  | `/health` | Liveness probe |
| `GET`  | `/status` | Counts + last run timestamp |
| `GET`  | `/posts/:monthKey` | List posts for a month (e.g. `2026-06`) |
| `GET`  | `/blogs/:monthKey` | List blog records for a month |
| `POST` | `/generate-calendar` | Generate next month's calendar (`?lookahead=N` to override) |
| `GET`  | `/zernio/accounts` | Sanity check Zernio connection |
| `POST` | `/telegram/test` | Send a test ping to your Telegram chat |
| `GET`  | `/images/<file>` | User-uploaded images, served to Zernio |

## Deploy to Railway

1. Push this repo to GitHub (`JHR-1/strong-marketing-agent`).
2. In Railway → **New Project → Deploy from GitHub repo** and pick the repo.
3. Railway will auto-detect `railway.toml` + `Dockerfile`.
4. Add a **Volume** mounted at `/app/data` (persists SQLite + uploaded
   images so they survive restarts and remain reachable for Zernio).
5. Set environment variables (copy from `.env.example`).
6. After first deploy, copy the Railway public URL and set:
   ```
   PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://strong-marketing-agent-production.up.railway.app
   ```
   This is critical — Zernio fetches every image from this URL when
   it publishes a post.
7. Hit `https://<your-service>.up.railway.app/health` to confirm it's live.

The cron (`0 9 20 * *` Europe/London) fires on the 20th of every month
to plan the upcoming month. For an immediate test, send `/generate` to
the Telegram bot.
